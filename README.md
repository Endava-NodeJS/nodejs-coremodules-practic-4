## Welcome to Node.js Workshop Practic Group 4

In this repository we track our workshop practical lession activity. So on each practical lession you should to create a new ```practica-{number of lesson}``` folder and place all related content there. If current scope work depends on code from previous lessions, so just copy it and place in the new lesson folder.

For indvidual work/experments please follow the next approach:
 - checkout new branch with your name from master branch with the latest changes.
 - place your work in the root of the repository with following naming pattern "```{your name}-solution-{number of the lesson, if necessary}```"


During the practical lessons, use ```practica``` branch for the work. Branch should contain the latest changes at the beggining of the each practical lesson, and all changes should be commit at the end.
